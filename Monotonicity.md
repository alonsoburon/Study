Describes the growth trend of a sequence

If it grows or stays the same as $n$ increases, its *monotone increasing*, if it **only** grows, its *strictly monotone increasing*

If it shrinks or stays the same as $n$ decreases, its *monotone decreasing*, if it **only** shrinks, its *strictly monotone decreasing*.

If the change in $n$ does not affect the sequence value, its *constant*.

Otherwise, its a *non-monotone* sequence.

Its monotonicity can affect the [[Sequence|sequence]]'s [[Boundedness|boundedness]]
