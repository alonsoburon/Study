A function is simply a mapping of elements between 2 sets.

In order for $f$ to be a **function** then
for every $x \in A$ there is a unique value $y \in B$ such that applying the function to $x$ returns $y$.

- ùë• ‚àà ùê¥ is called the argument or input variable (INPUT)
- $f(x) \in B$ for $x \in A$ is called the function value of ùë• (OUTPUT)
- ùê¥ is called the domain of the function $f$
- ùêµ is called the co-domain of the function $f$
- The image of the function $f$ is defined as the set of all function values, or outputs, that are produced by the function.

It can be composed and applied to another functions, however always remember $g$ o $f \neq f$ o $g$ 

### Injective functions

A function is said to be injective (or one-to-one) if every distinct element in the domain maps to a distinct element in the codomain.

### Surjective functions

A function is said to be surjective (or onto) if every element in the codomain is mapped to by at least one element in the domain, in other words, the function's range is equal to its codomain.

### Bijective functions

A function is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.  This means that every element in the domain maps to a unique element in the codomain, and every element in the codomain is mapped to by exactly one element in the domain.

If a function is **bijective**, then its inverse function exists.

### Inverse functions

An inverse function is one that maps elements back from the codomain of the original function to its domain. If $f$ is a bijective function, we can define an inverse function, denoted by $f^{-1}$, which "undoes" the action of $f$

### [[Monotonicity]]

Similar to sequence monotonicity, the monotonically increasing and decreasing property can be associated with functions as well. In this case it's not defined by integer values but rather by the relationship between input values and their corresponding output values.

A function is considered monotonically increasing if for any two input values,  $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 < x_2$, it always follows that $f(x_1) < f(x_2)$.

A function is considered monotonically decreasing if for any two input values, $x_1$ and $x_2$, where $x_1 < x_2$, it always follows that $f(x_1) > f(x_2)$.

##### Special cases
Consider that for a function, if we change the Domain or Codomain, the function may change if its monotonic or not in different spaces. This means the monotonicity of a function depens very much on its Domain and Codomain.
**Always** take into consideration the "$\text{for } x \in \textbf{R}$" or any other domain description of a function. 

## [[Curve Sketching]]
Often times, a function can be described without visualizing by identifying various values such as intercepts, asymptotes, critical points, and intervals of increase or decrease.
