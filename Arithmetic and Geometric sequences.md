## Arithmetic

A sequence is arithmetic if the difference between each step in the sequence is constant. This constant difference is called the common difference and notated $d$.

If the sequence differs or grows with $n$, then the sequence is not arithmetic, as the difference between terms is not constant.

To check this quickly, subtract 2 consecutive terms. If the result is a constant without $n$, then the sequence is arithmetic.
## Geometric

A sequence is geometric if the **ratio** between each step in the sequence is constant, meaning theres a constant multiplier, often denoted as $q$ for *quotient*, between consecutive terms.

To check this quickly, divide 2 consecutive terms. If the result is a constant without $n$, then the sequence is geometric.
