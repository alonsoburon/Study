A series is a sum of values of a sequence, often denoted as $$\sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i$$
 
### Types of Series
- **Finite Series**: sum of a finite sequence, can be represented as a simple Sum of all elements.
- **Infinite Series**: sum of an infinite sequence, has to be represented with a [[Limit|limit]], denoted as $$\sum_{i=0}^{\infty} a_i = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_i$$

### Convergence
An infinite series can (but not necessarily does) **only** [[Convergence|converge]] if the $\lim _{i \to \infty} a_i = 0$
A case where the series approaches 0 but is **not** convergent is, for example: $$\sum _{i=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{i}$$ 
which is a divergent series where $\lim_{i \to \infty} a_i = 0$ but the sum grows unbounded as values get added
