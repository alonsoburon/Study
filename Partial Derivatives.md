For functions with multiple variables like
${f_{(x,y,z)} = x^2 + y^3 + z^4}$
You can calculate separate [[derivatives]] for each variable, considering the other variables as constants.

$$\begin{align*}
f'_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 2x \\
f'_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 3y^2 \\
f'_z = \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} &= 4z^3
\end{align*}$$

Or even in cases when they combine like $f_{x,y} = 2x + 3y + 4xy$
You can ignore one or the other variable for the purpose of finding a derivative. When computing the partial derivative with respect to $x$, $y$ is treated as a fixed number, much like a coefficient.

$$\begin{align*}
f'_x = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} &= 2 + 4y \\
f'_y = \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} &= 3 + 4x
\end{align*}$$
