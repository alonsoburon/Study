- The derivative of a constant is 0
	- $f(x) = 5$ then $f'(x) = 0$.
- Multiplying by a constant remains in the derivative
	- For instance, if we have $g(x) = c \cdot f(x)$ then the derivative, $g'(x)$, is equal to $c \cdot f'(x)$
- Power rule: $f(x) $= x^n$ then $f'(x) = n \cdot x^{n-1}$. This rule allows us to differentiate functions that involve raising a variable to a power. (This also applies to fractionary exponents lixe $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$)
- Exponential functions:
	- $f(x) = a^x$ then $f'(x) = a^x \ln(a)$.  This means that the derivative of an exponential function where the base is a constant (like $e$ or $2$) is itself multiplied by the natural logarithm of the base.
	- $f(x)=e^x$ has a special property, in that its derivative is itself.  So,  $f'(x) = e^x$.
- Logarithmic functions: 
	- $f(x) = \log _a x$ then $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x \ln(a)}$ 
	- for natural logarithms, we have $f(x) = \ln(x) = \log_e x$, and therefore $f'(x) = \frac{1}{x \ln(e)} = \frac{1}{x}$ .
- Trigonometric functions: 
	- Trigonometric functions have their own set of derivatives.  For example, the derivative of $\sin , \cos , \tan , \cot , \sec , \& \csc$ each have distinct rules.
	- $f(x) = sin (x)$ then $f'(x) = cos(x)$
	- $f(x) = cos (x)$ then $f'(x) = -sin(x)$
	- $f(x) = tan(x)$ then $f'(x) = \frac{1}{\cos^2(x)} = 1+\tan ^2(x)$
	- $f(x) = cot(x)$ then $f'(x) = -\frac{1}{\sin^2(x)}$
	- $f(x) = sec(x)$ then $f'(x) = $sec(x)tan(x)$ 
	- $f(x) = csc(x)$ then $f'(x) = -csc(x)cot(x)$

- Summation rule:
	- $h(x) = f(x) + g(x)$, then the derivative, $h'(x)$, is equal to $$f'(x) + g'(x)$$.
- Product rule: 
	- $h(x) = f(x)g(x)$, then $$h'(x)= f'(x)g(x)+f(x)g'(x)$$
- Quotient rule: 
	- $h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}$, then its derivative, $h'(x)$, is found using the quotient rule: $$h'(x) = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$$
- Chain rule:
	- $f(g(x))' = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x)$
