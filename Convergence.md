Convergence of a sequence describes the behavior of a sequence as the index variable approaches infinity.

A sequence is said to converge to a limit if the terms of the sequence get arbitrarily close to a certain value as the index variable increases without bound. In other words, for a sequence to converge, the difference between the terms of the sequence and the limit value must approach zero as the index variable approaches infinity.

You can imagine this as a target $\epsilon$ that you're trying to hit with your sequence. No matter how small the target is, you must be able to hit it with your sequence for all index values beyond a certain point.

### Rules of thumb:
- Every convergent [[Sequence|sequence]] is [[Boundedness|bounded]].
- Every unbounded [[Sequence|sequence]] is divergent.
