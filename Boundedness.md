If $a_n$ is greater or equal than a constant, then the function $a$ is **bounded from below**, where the constant is its lower bound.
Usually this bound is called $s$.

If $a_n$ is lesser than or equal to a constant, then the function $a$ is **bounded from above**, where the constant is its upper bound.
Usually this bound is called $S$.

For a sequence to be bounded, it has to have an **upper** and a **lower** bound. All finite [[Sequence|sequences]] are bounded because they have a finite number of terms, which means the largest term can be considered the upper bound and the smallest term can be considered the lower bound.

Sometimes, a sequence can be seen as bounded but the strict value of its bounds may not be immediately apparent. This problem can be solved using the concept of [[Convergence|convergence]]
